This program is written for FCC certification under the curriculum "Scientific Computing with Python Projects".

This repository is created for viewing purpose only.
Please do not copy the code for cheating at the FCC certification.

I will make more changes in the future when my programming skill improved.
This is sufficient for the test_modules for now.
